NOTE: I remade this repo because for some reason the git file for the other repo got corrupted when I tried to pull a readme change i made in the browser. All of the changes from the initial commit of this repo are the differences between the last one of the old repo and this one. Sorry for the trouble! I'm going to try to figure out the error before I commit too much to this repo but it seems like its too complex for me...
